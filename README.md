> miRNA analyse for prostatic cancer detection

This project object objective is to develop an informatic tool to diagnostic prostatic cancer from miRNA present in the urine. This will concern those different subjects:
* Gene repression with miRNA
* Micro-arrays data of miRNA expression
* Statistic tools with Python (Scipy, Numpy,...)
* Artificial Intelligence for automatic learning
*
