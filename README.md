# DRAFT

Project in Bioinformatic and Computational Biology
===========
## miRNA analyse for prostatic cancer detection

> This is an HEIG-VD project

This project objective is to develop an informatic tool to diagnostic prostatic cancer from miRNA present in the urine. This will concern those different subjects:
* Gene repression with miRNA
* Micro-arrays data of miRNA expression
* Statistic tools with Python (Scipy, Numpy,...)
* Artificial Intelligence for automatic learning (Knn, SVM,...)

___________


The first goal of this project is to understand micro-arrays raw data and be able to process them in order to extract relevant and useful data.  
The second goal is to apply mathematical methods in order to extract the relevant miRNA that may be usable biomarkers. We'll try to reduce to the minimum the number of those miRNAs.   
Once we extracted the most promising miRNA, we'll train a machine learning model in order to be able to discriminate the sick patients from a test set of data.
